From 2.35.0, ExposureX will perform an integrity check of the `settings.dist.py` file to ensure it has not been modified. If the user changed this file (in the past or even now) the ExposureX instance will not start until those changes have been reverted.
Any customization of variables needs to be done via environmental variables or in 'local_settings.py'.
For more information check [Configuration documentation page](https://documentation.exposurex.com/getting_started/configuration/).

There are no other special instructions for upgrading to 2.35.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/ExposureX/django-ExposureX/releases/tag/2.35.0) for the contents of the release.
